Provision the cluster's acting identity so the #869 cluster-identity trust rule actually fires (#874).

The #869 trust machinery shipped correctly but was inert: it compared PR-feedback comment authors against a cluster identity that was never provisioned. On a scaffolded cluster with App credentials, `resolveClusterIdentity()` returns nothing (`gh api user` 403s on App installation tokens), so the trust predicate ran its degraded mode permanently and every first-party comment authored by the App bot was classified untrusted. This introduces a distinct **acting login** (the App bot account that authors the cluster's own comments) separate from the assignee-identity chain (whose issues the cluster works), normalizes the `[bot]` suffix so REST-form (`generacy-ai[bot]`) and GraphQL-form (`generacy-ai`) author logins compare equal, has both the local scaffolder and cloud-deploy write it, and makes the degraded mode observable — `clusterIdentity` is included in every `untrustedCommentSkips` warn and a single identity-resolution-failure error is emitted per process start when resolution fails.
