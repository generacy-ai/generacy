# Generacy

Frontend application for Generacy.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## MCP Testing Tools

For browser automation and UI testing, see:
[/workspaces/tetrad-development/docs/MCP_TESTING_TOOLS.md](/workspaces/tetrad-development/docs/MCP_TESTING_TOOLS.md)

Use Playwright MCP to automate testing of the frontend:
1. Start the dev server
2. Use `browser_navigate` to open the app
3. Use `browser_snapshot` to inspect elements
4. Use `browser_click`, `browser_type`, etc. to interact

## Development Stack

For Firebase emulators (required for backend):
```bash
/workspaces/tetrad-development/scripts/stack start
source /workspaces/tetrad-development/scripts/stack-env.sh
```

See [/workspaces/tetrad-development/docs/DEVELOPMENT_STACK.md](/workspaces/tetrad-development/docs/DEVELOPMENT_STACK.md)

## Credhelper Packages

- `packages/credhelper` — Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas for the credentials architecture (Phase 1, #458). Types-only, Zod-only dependency. Includes `LaunchRequestCredentials` type used by orchestrator.
- `packages/credhelper-daemon` — Runtime daemon for credential session management (#461). HTTP-over-Unix-socket API: `POST /sessions` (begin), `DELETE /sessions/:id` (end). Control socket at `/run/generacy-credhelper/control.sock`. Uses Node.js built-in `http` module, no Express.
  - `src/plugins/core/` — 7 core credential type plugins (#463): github-app, github-pat, gcp-service-account, aws-sts, stripe-restricted-key, api-key, env-passthrough. Statically registered via index file, not discovered via plugin loader.
  - `bin/credhelper-daemon.ts` — Entry point. Loads config from `.agency/` dir via `loadConfig()` (#477, Phase 6), builds `ConfigLoader` adapter, then starts daemon. Env var `CREDHELPER_AGENCY_DIR` overrides default `${PWD}/.agency`. Fails closed on invalid config.
  - `src/backends/` — BackendClient factory and implementations (#481, Phase 7a). `BackendClientFactory` dispatches on `BackendEntry.type`: `env` reads `process.env`. Factory injected into `SessionManager` via constructor DI. Unknown backend type error references `env` and `cluster-local` (forthcoming v1.5 phase 2). Cloud-side credential storage (`generacy-cloud` backend) and OIDC session-token auth removed in #488 (v1.5 phase 0).

## Orchestrator Launcher

- `packages/orchestrator/src/launcher/` — Plugin-based process launcher (`AgentLauncher`). Resolves intents to plugins, merges env (3-layer), selects `ProcessFactory` by stdio profile, spawns processes.
- Credentials interceptor (#465, Phase 3): When `LaunchRequest.credentials` is set, begins a credhelper session, merges session env, wraps command in entrypoint, sets uid/gid, ends session on exit. Uses HTTP-over-Unix-socket client (`node:http`) to communicate with credhelper daemon.
- Credentials integration (#478, Phase 6): `createAgentLauncher()` wires `CredhelperHttpClient` when the control socket exists. `WorkerConfig.credentialRole` (from `.generacy/config.yaml` `defaults.role`) flows to all spawn sites (`CliSpawner`, `PrFeedbackHandler`, `ConversationSpawner`), which populate `LaunchRequest.credentials`. Fail-fast at startup if role is configured but daemon is unavailable. Generic launcher paths (`cli-utils.ts`, `subprocess.ts`) deferred to follow-up.
